##This is my first time
There are two reasons to create a blog these days:  
1. Because everyone is doing it.
2. Because it is important to me to have a place to organize my thoughts.

We can dig in to these things more.

##Why is everyone blogging?
I can't help but wonder what sort of historical precedence there is for the amount of public open writing we have today in the form of blogging. Aside from the dawn of the internet, which of course makes it possible in the first place, it seems like we are still all trying to fulfill some sort of need that every person had before the dawn of the blog, but could never really enact previously. But anyways, I guess I have that need too, so thats why I will start blogging.

##Why should I blog?
There are a couple other selfish reasons why I think I should start blogging.
1. It encourages me to put stuff out there.
	I think it is too easy to keep myself wrapped up in my own world and never share anything I think outside of that. I have always had a desire to make things and have some impact of the world, and this very little act of blogging is one way to get used to doing that.
2. I need to clarify my ideas.
	I do a lot of thinking about things, but I never am forced to truley think hard about what I believe because I never need to write it down in a concrete way. Publishing a blog is one way to get used to this.
